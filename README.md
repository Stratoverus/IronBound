# IronBound
# Overview

IronBound is a roguelike game designed to deepen my understanding of C++ and modern software development. The project began as a console-based adventure, but I wanted to create a more engaging and visually dynamic experience, so I transitioned to building a full graphical user interface using SFML. This shift allowed me to explore event-driven programming, object-oriented design, and the practical use of C++ features such as inheritance and polymorphism.

The game challenges players to progress through a series of procedurally generated rooms, facing enemies, collecting loot, and making strategic decisions. My goal with IronBound was to move beyond basic console applications and create a more complex, interactive system that demonstrates both my technical growth and my passion for game development.

This game is currently not completed. As I made this game, feature creep became a real threat. I started adding more and more features, and of course, with each feature made, dozens of hours were required to finish this. I am showing off what I have right now, but plan on continuing this as I truly believe I have something unique here that could be really fun.

# Development Environment

Used Visual Studio Code to write the game. I am using GCC as my compiler. 

I coded this in c++. The main library I'm using for the gui is SFML 3.0.0.
